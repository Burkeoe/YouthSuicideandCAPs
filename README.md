# YouthSuicideandCAPs
Youth aged 10-18 accounted for 4.7% of North Carolina suicides in 2020, and in the same year experienced the highest numbers of self-inflicted injury ER visits above any other age group. Child approved psychiatrists, or CAPs, specialize in children's mental health and are able to prescribe life saving medication that improves the lives of troubled youth. However, they can be very hard to come by. This map shows the comparison of youth suicide rates per 100,000 in the year 2016, compared to the number of CAPs per 100,000 youth. More than 47 is considered a sufficient supply, 18-46 is a high shortage, and 1-17 is a severe shortage. 
I created this map as a potential resource for a news article discussing how suicide rates of youth in North Carolina are slowly on the rise, especially with the pandemic and the increasing threats of gun violence in schools across America. It also discussed the lack of child approved psychiatrists in the state, and how that is linked to high rates of depression as well. With so many children in need of mental health services and not enough CAPs to go around, parents trying to get their children help are met with long waits for appointments or rejection. My goal in creating this map was to allow the viewer to see the correlation between number of CAPs and youth suicide rates, and determine which counties are in greater need of child psychiatry practices.
